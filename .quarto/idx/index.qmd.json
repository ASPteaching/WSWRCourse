{"title":"Web Scraping With R","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Web Scraping With R"},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n**Description**\n\nAn important aspect when dealing with data in our days is that, very\noften, they can be obtained from the web although this is not\nnecessarily straightforward, that is they need to be downloaded and\ngo through some preprocessing and extraction processes, which depend\non the format in which they are stored in the web.\n\nThis course explores some of these formats jointly with the methods\nand tools used to retrieve data from the web and extract the desired\ninformation.\n\nThe first part introduces some common web technologies, their\nrelationship and some tools to manipulate and extract the\ninformation such as regular expressions. Next common formats for\nstoring web information (HTML, XML, JSON) are presented, as well\nas tools to extract it, as XPath and CSS selectors. Finally we\nintroduce some R packages suitable to process Web information\nand use them in some case studies.\n\n**Objectives**\n\nSpecifically at the end of the course students should:\n\n-   Be \tfamiliar with the main technologies to deal with information stored in the web.\n\n-   Be able to recognize the different formats that can be used for storage.\n\n-   Know how to extract information from these formats using specific R packages\n\n**Contents**\n\n1.  Introducing technologies. Web scrapping and web scrapping projects.\n\n2.  Data representation in the web HTML, XML, JSON. Other technologies.\t\n\n3.  Regular expressions for data manipulation.\t\n\n4.  Parsing HTML and XML. Using CSS selectors and XPath.\t\n\n5.  Case studies: (1) Parsing data from semi-structured documents. (2) Scraping\n    Twitter for Sentiment Analysis. (3) Gathering data from commercial sites\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":"cosmo","title":"Web Scraping With R"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

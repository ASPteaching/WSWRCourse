    "text": "An important aspect when dealing with data in our days is that, very often, they can be obtained from the web although this is not necessarily straightforward, that is they need to be downloaded and go through some preprocessing and extraction processes, which depend on the format in which they are stored in the web.\nThis course explores some of these formats jointly with the methods and tools used to retrieve data from the web and extract the desired information.\nThe first part introduces some common web technologies, their relationship and some tools to manipulate and extract the information such as regular expressions. Next common formats for storing web information (HTML, XML, JSON) are presented, as well as tools to extract it, as XPath and CSS selectors. Finally we introduce some R packages suitable to process Web information and use them in some case studies.\nObjectives\nSpecifically at the end of the course students should:\n\nBe familiar with the main technologies to deal with information stored in the web.\nBe able to recognize the different formats that can be used for storage.\nKnow how to extract information from these formats using specific R packages\n\nContents\n\nIntroducing technologies. Web scrapping and web scrapping projects.\nData representation in the web HTML, XML, JSON. Other technologies.\nRegular expressions for data manipulation.\nParsing HTML and XML. Using CSS selectors and XPath.\nCase studies: (1) Parsing data from semi-structured documents. (2) Scraping Twitter for Sentiment Analysis. (3) Gathering data from commercial sites"
